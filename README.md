### Pedro Tavarez
 I'm a fresh University of Massachusetts Lowell graduate who is motivated and excited to start his career. My formal graduation took place 5 months after my last semester at UML. In the meantime, I decided to keep myself busy by attending General Assembly. I took part in their web development immersive program, and I must say, it was one of the best decisions I ever made!

## Profile
At UML, I was a Criminology and Justice Studies major with a minor in Business and Concentration in Information and Technology. It was there that I learned how to create simple webpages with HTML and CSS, but I wanted to learn more. This led to my decision to take part in GA's web development program.
